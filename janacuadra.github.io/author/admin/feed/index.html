								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Design Management Europe award took place at Kumu Art Museum, Tallinn, Estonia the 23rd of september 2011, aiming to highlight the value of design management within a business. The DME Award recognizes those enterprises that have mastered the ability to put design at the service of their business strategies. The DME Award evaluation is based on four criteria, which were agreed upon by a group of experts in 2008: leadership in design innovation; driving change through design; excellence in design co-ordination and strategic performance. After a competition between 500 companies from European Union, Piodão get an honorable mention for the use of Design to reach a new market position.</p>
<p>Being the company&#8217;s head of Design at that time, It was a big reward for putting design ahead in the company&#8217;s business strategy.</p>
