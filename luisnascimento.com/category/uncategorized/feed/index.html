								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Book and App about the best of portuguese design<br />
16th september, 2015</p>
<p>Café Martinho da Arcada, Lisbon</p>
<p>Taking part into the official program of the Portuguese Design year 2014/15, the book Portugal by Design has been released.<br />
This publication developed by Silvadesigners, both in portuguese &amp; english, includes the projects of 95 portuguese designers. At the same time, an associated app is released for free on the Apple Store and Newstand by Apple , in order to diffuse this content worldwide.<br />
Jorge Silva was in charge to pick the authors and to design this book. He accepted the challenge of creating one of the possible portraits of portuguese design, through an informal approach, with a rhythm putting in context the work, meaning where it is consumed.<br />
The launch of the book took place the 6th of september at the Café Marthinho da Arcada, Lisbon with the secretary of state for Culture, Jorge Barreto Xavier, the curator of the portuguese design year, Guta Moura Guedes, and the author and designer, Jorge Silva. My project &#8220;Filter&#8221; was the project selected to be featured in the book.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Design and design award is an initiative from Marc Praquin. Everyday the homepage of DesignAndDesign.com is dedicated to two projects, one in graphic design and the other in product or packaging design. More than a virtual application, this is also a book published yearly with all the awarded project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realised that it is much easier for us designers to create things than to make a name for ourselves. So I decided to offer our community a simple yet powerful tool, completely free of charge, to free us from the monopoly of mainstream media and, at long last, let us speak for ourselves. This is how the Design and Design project got started. Already a reference in more than 160 countries, this tool is now being extended to a non-virtual application: every year, all awarded projects are published in The Design and Design Book of the Year.&#8221;<br />
Marc Praquin, Designer</p>
<p>I was reward both in 2014 for the best product design with &#8220;Blue Ink&#8221;, a shoes cabinet develop with David Rodrigues in December, 13th and for the best packaging design with &#8220;Natural&#8221; a salt and pepper shaker in December, 16th. These projects are in the Design and Design Book volume 7 which was release December, 14th, 2014.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackCork, Maison &amp; Objet at Now ! Design à vivre</p>
<p>Blackcork is a Portuguese contemporary furniture brand. The essence of the brand is based on the transformation of a material: expanded black cork.<br />
Sofalca, a company from Portugal, manufacturer of black cork expanded agglomerate since 1966, for thermic and acoustic insulation in construction and decoration in architecture, is now design editor: intended to sublimate the subject betting heavily on original and innovative design with the brand Blackcork.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My Sweet Design Fair is the latest curatorial experiment from creative collective Hello Randomness whose goal is to create a space for a kind of design which is to arty to be commercial and too commercial to be art. It took place during the Dutch Design Week at Eindhoven, Netherlands from 19th to 27th of October 2013.</p>
<p>My project &#8220;Universal&#8221; a collection of cork bath plugs with different and original shapes was selected, to be part of the exhibition.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boisbuchet integrates innovative architecture and design into the splendid setting of a 19th century estate. They invest in a culture that respects the past and builds for the future, research into a sustainable relationship between the natural and the man-made and offer a creative environment for people of all cultures to share.</p>
<p>The international community of designers and architect was challenged to design new and innovative uses for cork products or improve the existing portfolio of corked/based product. It results in a workshop for a competition organized by Vitra Design Museum and Domaine de Boisbuchet in partnership with Corticeira Amorim, the portuguese world market leader in cork production at the Domaine de Boisbuchet in France September 2012.</p>
<p>I was in the short listed with 20 other competitors invited to a specialized workshop where I submit my project known as &#8220;Universal&#8221;. It&#8217;s a cork bath plug with different and original shapes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aside to the Experimentadesign Biennal, Timeless was a special event setting up at the Museu do Oriente in Lisbon, Portugal from September,9th to November, 8 2009. More than an exhibition, this event has been created by Frederico Duarte + Pedrita. Timeless focuses on a theme that is of paramount importance in today&#8217;s society, as well in our future as inhabitants of planet earth. Timeless dwells on raising the level of production explores the use of less resources. It invokes not only the analysis of the consumption of raw materials in productive processes, but also the reconsideration of the final product in terms of efficiency and performance.</p>
<p>Designers have the comptetence, the ability to rethink the way in which we are, presently, producing artefacts &#8211; wether tangible or intagible &#8211; intended for our needs, simultaneously proposing new methods, new solutions and new formats, therefore making our daily life easier and lowring the consumption of resources.</p>
<p>Cartão desCrédito is a project made by The Office (Luis Nascimento + David Rodrigues), that includes one website and equipment developed in cardboard aiming to propose a new way to rethink consumer society and design challenges.</p>
